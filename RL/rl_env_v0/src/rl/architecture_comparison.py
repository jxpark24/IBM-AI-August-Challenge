"""Architecture comparison A / B / C / D (PDF section 10.1).

The section 2 acceptance table lists this as a minimum criterion:

    Current architecture benchmark -- "Direct-to-ground and two-GEO-relay
    scenarios run using the same traffic and seeds."
    LEO/hybrid architecture -- "Eight LEO relays are selectable alongside GEO
    and ground paths."

Everything else measured so far is hybrid-only, so the project's central claim --
that a hybrid network beats direct-only and GEO-only -- has had no evidence
behind it. This produces that evidence.

    A  direct only   science satellite -> ground station
    B  GEO only      science satellite -> one of 2 GEO relays -> ground
    C  LEO mesh      science satellite -> one or more of 8 LEO relays -> ground
    D  hybrid        direct, LEO and GEO all available; the router selects

An architecture is expressed as the set of nodes a bundle may traverse. The
restriction is applied in two places at once, and it must be both:

    the action mask   so no policy can route through an excluded node
    the contact list  so the router PLANS within the architecture rather than
                      planning a hybrid route and then having it vetoed

Applying only the first would measure "hybrid router with its hands tied", which
is a different and much less interesting question.
